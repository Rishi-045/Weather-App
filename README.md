# Weather-App
 The Weather App is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to display current weather conditions like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and descriptions. Users can search for weather in any city or use geolocation to get local weather updates.
